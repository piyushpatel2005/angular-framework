# Angular Material Library

Angular materials is a library developed with angular components. It includes custom components that can be included in your project and make the project development faster. It is like Bootstrap with custome css classes. Instead, it has custom tags and properties for tags that design the layout differently.

This project includes Angular Materials library which is actually beta version 11. So, it might change in the future.

Please, check out the official [docs](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/)

**Note:** The instructions in the resources folder includes instructions for Beta version 8, so those instructions are no longer valid when working with Angular Materials.
